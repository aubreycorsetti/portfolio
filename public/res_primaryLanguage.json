      "description": "üëã Hello, my name is Aubrey Corsetti and I am a Software Developer. Before changing my career towards tech, I was a dog groomer and a solar panel salesperson. Two very different things.. fortunately from that I've learned many skills that may not be tech but I can bring into my tech career such as; time management, the ability to multitask and swift problem solving skills. I decided to go into software development because I've always been intrigued with how websites/apps are built and presented to the user as well as coming up with ways on how I would improve them. This is why I chose to specialize in Python üêç. I would love to use my skill in a fun environment that is open-minded, allows me to be creative and aims to leave a positive, memorable experience for the user. I am sure that no matter where I go in life, tech will always be a passion of mine and I am always excited to create something that will be used by many. üí´",
